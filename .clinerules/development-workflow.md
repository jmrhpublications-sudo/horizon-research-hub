## Brief overview
Guidelines for code creation, file editing, and git workflow without local execution or package installation.

## Code creation
- Write complete, functional code for new pages, components, and files
- Create components with proper imports and exports
- Link new components/pages to the existing application structure (routing, navigation)
- Ensure all necessary imports are included for the code to work

## File editing
- Edit existing files as needed to integrate new functionality
- Update routing, navigation, or other linking mechanisms to connect new components
- Make all necessary modifications to ensure new features work within the existing system

## Development workflow
- Do not run code locally or install packages
- Write all code and create all files needed
- Push changes directly to git
- Assume dependencies are already available in the environment

## Git operations
- Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages
- Push to remote repository after completing code changes
- No local testing or development server required
